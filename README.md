# titanic-shipwreck-analysis
Titanic dataset classification project using logistic regression. It loads training and test datasets, performs data preprocessing, trains a logistic regression model, and generates predictions for passenger survival based on the test set.

# Project Objectives

- Perform feature engineering and data preprocessing on the Titanic dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.
- Train and optimize a logistic regression model, utilizing relevant hyperparameters, to predict binary survival outcomes based on the processed input features.
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring the model's robustness on unseen data.
- Generate and export survival predictions for the test dataset in CSV format, adhering to competition standards for submission and assessment.
